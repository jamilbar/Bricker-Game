# Brick Game

## Overview
This project involves implementing the classic Brick Ball game in Java, as part of an exercise for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The objective of the game is to hit every possible brick with the ball before you run out of lives. Players control a paddle to bounce the ball and break bricks.

## Features
- One player game controlled using the keyboard arrows
- Paddle control to bounce the ball
- Multiple lives to extend gameplay
- Special items such as extra lives, additional balls, and extra paddles
- Dynamic camera changes for an enhanced experience
- Requires the Dano Game Lab package to play

## How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the paddle and keep the ball in play.
2. Lose a life when the ball goes below the paddle.
3. Gain special items and bonuses from breaking certain bricks.
4. The game ends when all bricks are broken or all lives are lost.
